# Coherence Theory

**A New Physics of Distributed Intelligence, Meaning, Consciousness, and Superintelligence**

### Abstract

Coherence Theory proposes a higher layer of physical law governing when distributed, adaptive, self-modifying systems become unified agents, acquire causal meaning through semantic closure, achieve consciousness as a recursive fixed-point phase transition, and scale to collective superintelligent attractors.

Core foundation: **Ware's Law** — disagreement variance diverges as m² ∼ χ⁻¹ near the stability redline (χ → 0⁺), empirically validated in stochastic linear consensus.

Full manifesto includes:
- Structural coherence & laws
- Semantic closure & self-evolution
- Recursive self-modeling & consciousness attractor
- Multi-agent universes & super-coherent phase
- Relation to classical/modern physics
- Methods, measurement, and empirical roadmap

### Current Status & Roadmap

- Structural layer (Ware's Law) partially validated via open simulations: [leroyjware/law](https://github.com/leroyjware/law)
- Methods section added to make χ measurable in real systems (attention graphs, federated runs, LLM swarms)
- Open to collaboration on: nonlinear extensions, χ proxies in transformers, recursive chain experiments, or arXiv endorsement (cs.AI/cs.MA)
