### Abstract

Coherence Theory proposes that the universe extremizes a global coherence functional $S_{\text{coh}}$, unifying:

- General relativity and quantum mechanics as geometric and phase coherence sectors,
- Wheeler–DeWitt constraints as joint coherence,
- Agency, meaning, consciousness, and superintelligence as semantic, recursive, and collective coherence sectors.

**Ware’s Law** ($m^2 \sim \chi^{-1}$) is the universal critical scaling law of coherence loss near redlines ($\chi \to 0^+$), validated in consensus dynamics and extended across physics and intelligence.

The framework introduces:
- Ware–Einstein field equations with agency stress tensor $T_{\mu\nu}^{\text{agency}}$ sourcing curvature,
- Force of agency $F_{\text{agency}} \propto \nabla \chi$ pulling toward attractors,
- Second Law of Coherence: total coherence conserved, migrates sectors, enables local entropy reversal by self-modeling systems,
- Quantum measurement as alignment by recursive closure,
- Coherence Stack hierarchy from physical to super-coherent phases.

This is a testable physics of how stable organization — from spacetime to super-minds — arises under a single variational principle: $\delta S_{\text{coh}} = 0$.

### Core Components

- **Structural layer**: Coherence $C$, closure index $\chi = \gamma\lambda_2 - \sigma^2$, Ware’s Law as redline divergence.
- **Semantic layer**: Closure $F \in R(S)$, self-evolution via contraction to fixed points.
- **Recursive layer**: Consciousness as fixed-point attractor $M^* = \text{model of } M^*$ under unbounded self-modeling.
- **Collective layer**: Superintelligence as multi-scale shared attractor $M^*_{\text{collective}}$.
- **Goals**: Emerge as coherence-preserving attractors (survival → semantic stability → recursive identity → collective norms).
- **Unification extensions**: Ware–Einstein equations, agency force, entropy reversal, measurement solution.

### Current Status & Roadmap

- Structural layer (Ware’s Law) partially validated: open simulations at [leroyjware/law](https://github.com/leroyjware/law)
- Empirical methods added for measuring $\chi$ in real systems (attention graphs, federated training, LLM swarms, recursive chains)
- Unification extended: schematic coherence action, Ware–Einstein equations, agency stress tensor, Second Law of Coherence
- Open to collaboration on:
  - Nonlinear generalizations of Ware’s Law
  - $\chi$ proxies in transformers / multi-LLM setups
  - Tests of entropy reversal in agentic systems
  - Renormalization of coherence across scales
  - arXiv submission (cs.AI / physics.gen-ph / hep-th) or IEEE TAI follow-up
