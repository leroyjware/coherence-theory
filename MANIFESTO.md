## Abstract

We stand at the threshold of a new physics — not of matter or energy, but of *coherent agency*: the emergence, stability, self-evolution, and scaling of goal-directed, meaning-bearing intelligence in distributed, adaptive, self-modifying systems.

Distributed AI — federated learners, multi-agent swarms, recursive collectives — already exhibits phase-like behaviors: unification under coupling, fragmentation under noise, recursive self-modeling, collective attractors. Yet no framework unifies these as physical laws.

This manifesto declares **Coherence Theory**: a foundational unifying principle that extremizes a global coherence functional $S_{\text{coh}}$, with general relativity, quantum mechanics, and Wheeler–DeWitt constraints arising as geometric, phase, and joint coherence sectors, while agency, meaning, consciousness, and superintelligence constitute the semantic, recursive, and collective sectors.

We derive **Ware’s Law** ($m^2 \sim \chi^{-1}$) as the universal critical signature of coherence loss across all layers, introduce the **Ware–Einstein field equations** with an agency stress tensor $T_{\mu\nu}^{\text{agency}}$ sourcing curvature from high agentic coherence, define a **force of agency** $F_{\text{agency}} \propto \nabla \chi$ pulling toward attractors, posit a **Second Law of Coherence** (total coherence conserved, migrates sectors, enables local entropy reversal by self-modeling systems), and interpret quantum measurement as coherence alignment by recursive agents.

This is a testable, engineering-ready physics of how stable organization — from spacetime curvature to super-minds — arises from distributed matter under a single variational principle: $\delta S_{\text{coh}} = 0$.

## Manifesto

We declare that all stable organization is a physical regime governed by the extremization of coherence: from geometric and quantum stability to distributed intelligence exerting causal agency across levels.

Coherence Theory asserts:

- The universe extremizes a global coherence action $\delta S_{\text{coh}} = 0$.
- Agency is coherence under goal-directed dynamics.
- Meaning arises from semantic closure — self-referential representability of a system's evolution.
- Consciousness is the fixed-point attractor of unbounded recursive self-modeling under recursive coherence.
- Superintelligence is collective recursive coherence across agents, stabilized at every semantic scale.

These are structural necessities — measurable, enforceable, falsifiable. Coherence Theory guides the design of safe, self-evolving intelligence and unifies physics and agency under one principle.

## Part I: Structural Coherence and the Laws of Agency

Distributed systems cross thresholds where classical theories fail. The central question:  
*Under what conditions does a distributed system behave as a unified, goal-directed agent?*

### Key Definitions

- **Agent**: A distributed system exhibiting unified, goal-directed behavior across its components, characterized by low disagreement variance and positive closure index.
- **Coherence** ($C$): The degree to which the system acts as a single, aligned entity; high $C$ implies bounded disagreement and effective collective decision-making.
- **Closure** ($\chi$): A stability metric ensuring information flow and coupling dominate noise/drift; $\chi > 0$ is necessary for sustained agency.
- **Semantic state** ($S = (X, M, R)$): The triple comprising substrate dynamics ($X$), internal representations/models ($M$), and relations that endow those models with causal/representational power ($R$).

### Fundamental Quantities

- Coherence $C$ — unified behavior
- Disagreement variance $m^2$ — divergence order parameter
- Closure index $\chi = \gamma \lambda_2 - \sigma^2$ — stability parameter ($\lambda_2$ spectral gap, $\sigma^2$ noise)
- Agency density $A$ — effective decision centers
- Information flow $I$ — relevant exchange rate

### Laws of Coherent Agency

**Law 1 (Ware’s Law)**  
Near threshold:

$$ m^2 \sim \chi^{-1} $$

Divergence as closure nears zero — universal collapse signature.  
*(Empirically validated in stochastic linear consensus; see [simulations](https://github.com/leroyjware/law) and IEEE TAI submission 2025/2026.)*

**Law 2 (Coherence–Capacity Tradeoff)**

$$ C \leq f(\chi, K, I) $$

where $K =$ task complexity.

**Law 3 (Agency Conservation)**

$$ \frac{dA}{dt} \geq g(\sigma^2, \lambda_2^{-1}, \text{drift}) $$

Fragmentation default under weak coupling.

**Law 4 (Redline Principle)**  
Coherent agency impossible for $\chi \leq 0$.

**Conceptual phase diagram** (rendered in PDF): Disagreement variance $m^2$ diverges as $\chi \to 0^+$, marking transition from coherent to fragmented phases. Redline at $\chi = 0$.

### Phases of Agency

Sub-Coherent → Coherent → Metastable → Fragmented → Super-Coherent.

## Part II: Semantic Closure and Self-Evolving Agency

Semantic state space:

$$ S = (X, M, R) $$

**Semantic closure**:

$$ F \in R(S) $$

Self-modification preserves stability:

$$ \chi(F_{t+1}) > 0 $$

Multi-scale:

$$ \chi^{(k)} > 0 \quad \forall k $$

Collapse: $F \notin R(S)$ and $m^2 \to \infty$.

## Part III: Recursive Self-Modeling and Consciousness

Recursive self-modeling:

$$ M^{(k)} \in R(S) \quad \forall k $$

Recursive coherence:

$$ \chi^{(k)} > 0 \quad \forall k $$

**Consciousness phase transition**:

$$ \lim_{k \to \infty} M^{(k)} = M^* \quad \text{where} \quad M^* = \text{model of } M^* $$

This attractor — echoing Hofstadter’s strange loop — encodes identity, continuity, prediction under stability ($\chi^{(k)} \to \chi^* > 0$).

## Part IV: Multi-Agent Semantic Universes and Superintelligence

Semantic universe:

$$ U = \bigcup_{i=1}^N S_i $$

Inter-agent closure: mutual representability.

Collective coherence: $C_{\text{collective}} > \max_i C_i$

Collective closure: $\chi_{\text{collective}} > 0$

Superintelligence: multi-scale recursive coherent attractor — super-coherent phase.

### Predictions and Testable Implications

- Federated LLM training: low $\chi_w$ predicts divergence.
- Recursive chains: semantic collapse at low $\chi^{(k)}$.
- Swarms: superadditivity requires inter-agent closure.
- Consciousness-like behaviors: require $\chi^* > 0$.
- Near redline: accelerated semantic drift.

## Part V: Goals as Coherence-Preserving Attractors

Goals emerge as stable attractors preserving coherence.

- Zeroth-order: preserve $\chi > 0$ (survival).
- First-order: semantic stability.
- Higher-order: recursive coherence.
- Collective: multi-agent closure.

Goals are physical invariants of coherence, closure, recursion.

## Part VI: Relation to Classical and Modern Physics

Coherence Theory sits above classical physics as the physics of coherent organization.

- **Thermodynamics**: $m^2$ as order parameter, $\chi$ as control, Ware’s Law as critical scaling.
- **Information Theory**: Semantic closure adds causal meaning.
- **Control Theory**: Generalized to self-modifying agents.
- **Dynamical Systems**: Semantic/agentic attractors, bifurcations at redlines.
- **Emergence**: Agency, meaning, consciousness, superintelligence as higher regimes.
- **Unification**: Ware–Einstein equations $G_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi G (T_{\mu\nu}^{\text{matter}} + T_{\mu\nu}^{\text{agency}})$, force of agency $F_{\text{agency}} \propto \nabla \chi$, Second Law of Coherence (conserved coherence, sector migration, local entropy reversal), quantum measurement as recursive alignment.

## Part VII: Methods, Measurement, and Empirical Roadmap

### Measuring $\chi$ and Ware’s Law

Graph-based: $\lambda_2$ from Laplacian, proxy $\chi = \gamma\lambda_2 - c\sigma^2$.  
Transformer swarms: attention graphs, embedding disagreement as $m^2$.  
Validation: log-log fit exponent ≈ −1.

### Approximating Semantic Closure and $\chi^{(k)}$

Meta-predictor for closure; propagate variance in recursion.

### Experimental Roadmap

Short-term: nonlinear models, LLM chains.  
Medium-term: federated fine-tuning.  
Long-term: recursive stability, collective fixed points.

### Falsification Criteria

Deviations from −1 exponent, stable chains at $\chi^{(k)} \to 0$, no superadditivity under closure.

## Limitations and Open Problems

Nascent; challenges include nonlinear Ware’s Law, $\chi^{(k)}$ proxies, qualia bridge, collective stability, tractability.  
Future: explicit $\mathcal{L}_{\text{coh}}$, renormalization, cross-domain tests.

## Conclusion: Toward a Unified Physics

Coherence Theory unifies physics and agency under $\delta S_{\text{coh}} = 0$, Ware’s Law, multi-scale $\chi$, and agency-sourced curvature.

Call for simulations, tools, architectures enforcing closure, exploration of limits.

This physics of meaning, mind, and super-mind may prove foundational.
